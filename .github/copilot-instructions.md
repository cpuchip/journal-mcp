## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL NOTES FOR CODING AGENT

### Current Architecture
- **MCP Server**: Uses mcp-go v0.39.1 library
- **Data Storage**: JSON files in `~/.journal-mcp/` directory
- **Transport**: Stdio protocol for MCP communication
- **Structure**: Task-centric with temporal views

### Key Implementation Details
- Function signatures use `(ctx context.Context, request mcp.CallToolRequest)` 
- Use `request.RequireString()` and `request.GetString()` helper methods
- Return `mcp.NewToolResultText()` or `mcp.NewToolResultError()`
- Tool registration uses `mcp.NewTool()` with option functions

### Development Environment
- Go 1.23.2
- Windows PowerShell development environment
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/cpuchip/journal-mcp
- Local data storage in user home directory

### Testing Commands
```powershell
# Run all tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Test MCP server
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list"}' | .\journal-mcp.exe

# Create task example
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "create_task", "arguments": {"id": "TEST-123", "title": "Test task", "type": "work"}}}' | .\journal-mcp.exe

# Test pagination
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 3, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "list_tasks", "arguments": {"limit": "5", "offset": "0"}}}' | .\journal-mcp.exe

# Test date filtering
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 4, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "list_tasks", "arguments": {"date_from": "2025-01-01", "date_to": "2025-12-31"}}}' | .\journal-mcp.exe
```
